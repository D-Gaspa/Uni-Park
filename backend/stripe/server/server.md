To use another platform was decided because the compatibility and accessibility needs were critical for testing with both iOS and Android devices. Using a localhost setup often poses challenges when connecting from physical mobile devices, as they do not recognize 'localhost' as the server running on your machine. To ensure that the server is accessible from the devices where the React Native app is running, deploying the server on a platform like Glitch provides a universally accessible URL, bypassing the limitations of a local network. Additionally, while configuring CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is feasible for enabling cross-origin requests on a local server, using an online development environment like Glitch simplifies the setup and ensures immediate compatibility across different testing environments without the need for additional network configuration
